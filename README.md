## Welcome to OKC Districts ðŸ˜„ 

<img src="/images/okcdistricts.png">

A full-stack Node.js project I built using RESTful routing, to help me find and explore the unique districts of Oklahoma City. I decided to create the app after relocating to OKC from Minnesota and wanting to explore the city more from a local lens.


## Learning Recap 

Successfully built full front end using Bootstrap 3, and created each individual component. Tested to ensure fully performing and that all links work correctly. Setup database using MongoDB atlas and working to continue improvements
